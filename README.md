## Milestone Project 2 

This is a rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock game that allows the user to play against a computer with randomized choices. The rules are simple:

Scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. Rock crushes scissors.
